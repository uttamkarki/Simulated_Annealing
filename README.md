# Simulated_Annealing
Simulated Annealing Algorithm mimics metallurgical annealing, adapting to explore solution spaces. Gradually reducing "bad" moves, it avoids local optima, excelling in combinatorial, scheduling, and parameter optimization, offering robust solutions in diverse, complex scenarios.
