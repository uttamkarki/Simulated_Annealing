# Simulated Annealing Algorithm

The Simulated Annealing Algorithm is a sophisticated optimization technique inspired by metallurgical annealing. This approach effectively explores solution spaces, allowing for controlled moves between solutions, making it particularly adept at escaping local optima.

## Features

- **Stochastic Exploration:** Balances exploration and exploitation, intelligently navigating complex landscapes.
- **Annealing Process:** Progressively reduces "bad" moves, improving solution quality over time.
- **Global Optimization:** Overcomes local optima, seeking higher-quality solutions in various optimization problems.
- **Adaptability:** Customizable cooling schedules and acceptance functions for fine-tuning.
- **Domain Diversity:** Applied in diverse domains, from engineering and logistics to machine learning and finance.

## Usage

1. **Define Objective:** Formulate an optimization problem with a well-defined objective function.
